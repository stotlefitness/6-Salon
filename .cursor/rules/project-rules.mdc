# Project Rules

This project uses modular rule files. The rules are organized into the following files:

- **foundation.mdc** - Core principles: mindset, communication, consistency, safety, decision-making, feature development, file creation, data handling, error handling, and project-specific patterns.

- **research-context.mdc** - Guidelines for researching the codebase before making changes: pattern search, honoring abstractions, understanding data flow, version awareness.

- **modularity.mdc** - File organization and code structure: file size guidelines, when to extract code, composition patterns, avoiding fragmentation.

- **backend.mdc** - Backend architecture rules: Supabase (default) and Convex conventions, schema design, migrations, RLS, auth, API routes.

- **ui-tailwind.mdc** - UI and styling conventions: Tailwind usage, className organization, design tokens, responsiveness, component patterns, accessibility.

All rule files have `alwaysApply: true` and are automatically applied to every AI request in this repository.
